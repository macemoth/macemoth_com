== Basic formatting
- /\/italics\//
- *\*bold\**
- +\+monospace\++
- +\-+ is a hyphen (-)
- +\-\-+ is an en-dash (--)
- +\-\-\-+ is an em-dash (---)
- +\.\.\.+ is an ellipsis (...)
- +\~+ is a non-breaking space (~)
- +\#+ begins a comment, for the remainder of the line
- +\\C+ is \C
- +\\R+ is \R
- +\\M+ is \M
- `singly quoted text' is written +\`singly quoted text\'+
- "doubly quoted text" is written +\"doubly quoted text\"+
- jemdoc's apostrophes are converted automatically from +jemdoc\'s+ input
- the sequence +\\n+ \n forces a manual line break
- paragraphs are separated by blank lines
- +\$inline LaTeX equation\$+
- +\\( LaTeX equation on its own line \\)+
- +\#+s (and only +\#+s) must be quoted in URLs

== Blocks
~~~
{Code block syntax}{}
\~~~
\{Optionally empty title}{Optionally empty highlight mode}
Code block with monospaced text.
\~~~
~~~

~~~
{Information block}
Omit the second pair of braces in the first line of the block (or omit the whole
first line altogether if you don't want a title) and you will get an
/information block/. All the usual conventions apply in here.
~~~

== Headings and lists
Headings are defined by starting a line with +=+.
- += Heading level 1+
- +== Heading level 2+, /etc./

Lists are defined with +-+ for bulleted lists, +.+ for numbered lists and +:+
for lists of definitions. Here is some code and the resulting list:

~~~
{}{}
- Bullet level one
    -- Bullet level two

. Number level one
    .. Number level two
    .. Number level two (again)

: {jemdoc} light markup
: {asciidoc} a great alternative, but more complicated

== Preventing matches
- a literal backslash (\\) is written +{{\\\\}}+ 
- the literal characters \/, \*, \+ and \~ and \# are written +\\/+, +\\*+,
  +\\\++, +\\\~+ and +\\\#+ to avoid the above formatting
- +\\\...+ avoids an ellipsis
- +-\\-+ avoids an en-dash
- +-\\-\\-+ avoids an em-dash
- +\\\`+ gives a back-tick (\`)
- +\\\'+ gives an ordinary single quotation mark (\')
- +\\\"+ gives an ordinary double quotation mark (\")

== Images
For normal images, use
~~~
{}{}
+\[img\{width\}\{height\}\{alttext\} location caption\]+.
~~~
- Replace +location+ with the path of the image
- +width+, +height+, +alttext+ can be left empty (but there are good reasons not to do so)

== Other stuff
- +\{\{html text\}\}+ will insert +html text+ directly into the output document
  without performing any substitutions. (This is for inline escaping; use
  [extra.html raw blocks] for larger amounts of html.)
- +\%quoted tt\%+ is an alias for +\+{\{quoted tt\}\}\++. It's not quite as
  robust, so use +\+{\{plus signs with double brace blocks}\}\++ if you run into
  problems with some characters.
- +{\\{text}\\}+ /will/ perform replacements and insert {\{text}\}.

This page is not exhaustive.

= Extras

These are some extended syntax options that may come in useful.

== Left aligned image blocks
As seen [https://mesoler.com/ here], for example,
left-aligned image blocks place an image and allow ordinary jemdoc marked-up
text to flow around the right-hand side.
~~~
{Left-aligned image block syntax}{}
\~~~
\{}{img_left}{FILENAME.IMG}{alt text}{WIDTHpx}{HEIGHTpx}{IMGLINKTARGET}
Ordinary jemdoc markup goes here.
\~~~
~~~

All arguments may be left blank, though you should specify an image filename,
and alt text should be descriptive for reasons like
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Alternative_text_for_images those given
by Wikipedia].

== Raw blocks
When placing large amounts of raw html, you should use a raw block instead of
+\{\{inline html escaping\}\}+. As well as cleaner syntax, raw blocks will avoid
having +<p>+ tags in the wrong places.
~~~
{Raw block syntax}{}
\~~~
\{}{raw}
Any text here will be copied straight to the output file without processing.
\~~~
~~~

== Other character sets
Here's a quick example of how to include text in a language with a different
character set.

To include Korean ({{<span lang="ko" xml:lang="ko">}}한국말{{</span>}}),
use something like this:
~~~
{}{}
{{<span lang="ko" xml:lang="ko">}}한국말{{</span>}}
~~~

([jacobm@stanford.edu Let me know] if you need better support for your
language.)

== Including other files
The line
~~~
{}{}
\#include{otherfile.jemdoc}
~~~
will include the contents of +otherfile.jemdoc+ as if the contents were actually
in the ordinary input file (that is, with full jemdoc substitutions).
The line
~~~
{}{}
\#includeraw{otherfile.html}
~~~
will copy the contents of +otherfile.html+ verbatim to the current position in
the output file (that is, without any jemdoc substitutions).
