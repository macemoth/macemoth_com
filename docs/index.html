  <p> <h2>About</h2>
<p>I am cofounder of <a href="https://algolas.com">Algolas</a>, a Swiss startup that provides software engineering as a service and tries to bridge the gap between AI and no-bs software engineering. Part-time, I do similar things as an IT consultant for <a href="https://ethjuniors.ch">ETH juniors</a>.
In September 2023 I finished my Master's in Computer Science at the University of St. Gallen.</p>
<p>My technical skills include core CS topics, such as developing software and algorithms, information security, machine learning, making IT infrastructure and networks work and some current fancy front- and backend frameworks.
The "simulated thinking" that LLMs exhibit fascinates me. Despite the hype, I believe the "simulated intelligence" is an amazing discovery that we <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html">don't really understand yet</a>.</p>
<p>I am strong proponent for a dedicated interconnect between science and business, as I think that both ends have moved apart from each other, despite pressing issues that require both.</p>
<p>Also, I like thinking in a holistic and interconnected way rather than being ultra-specialised - in the spirit of Freeman Dyson's <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-math-puzzle-worthy-of-freeman-dyson-20140326/">"The Scientist as Rebel"</a>. That's one of the reasons why Computer Science is fun!
As a consequence, my scientific interest is particularly in <a href="https://necsi.edu/complexity-rising-from-human-beings-to-human-civilization-a-complexity-profile">Complex Systems</a>, combining the insights of fields from Biology, Theoretical Physics and Engineering to understand real-world problems that are not confined to human-made borders in science.</p>
<p>I like spending time reading wildly through the Internet, on my bike (motor and muscle), in my running shoes, on the water or playing the violin (I like both classical music and art). Also, I am interested in the Internet of the 90s and 2000s.</p>
